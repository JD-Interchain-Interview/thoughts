### Overview

### The logo is not the brand

---

**In this section, we will only be diving into the trademark.**
The purpose behind trademarks is to allow companies to indicate the source of their goods or services and to distinguish them from others in the industry.

Here are the first thoughts that crossed my mind —

| Logo Transformation                                        | Logo Transition — Interchain & Interchain Gmbh         |

**Logo Transformation Process**

- [ ] Start with the original logo
- [ ] Strip the logo colors
- [ ] Smooth out the edges
- [ ] Move typeface from `Upper Case` to `Sentence Case`
- [ ] Add a logo transition to Interchain Gmbh

  <h6> I don't think there is anything wrong with the original logo, but I think it could be a bit more refined. </h6>

### First pass styling

  <p>The purpose of this is to allow interchain to speak to the broader general population while allowing it's minimalistic style to accommodate a variety of other design systems within the global ecosystem and future design trends.</p>
